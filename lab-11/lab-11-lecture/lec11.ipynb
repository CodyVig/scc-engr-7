    "Let's summarize a few things about the different classes here:\n",
    "1. The <b>Deck</b> class has <b>Card</b> objects (<b>has a</b> relationship)\n",
    "2. The <b>Player</b> class also has <b>Card</b> objects (<b>has a</b> relationship)\n",
    "3. The <b>Dealer</b> class is a specific type of a <b>Player</b> (<b>is a</b> relationship)\n",
    "4. The <b>TwentyOne</b> class has a <b>Deck</b>, <b>Player</b>, and <b>Dealer</b> (all are examples of <b>has a</b> relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional vs OOP approach \n",
    "So now we have written two different programs that play the same card game. One of them was written with a functional approach (Lab 4), and the other one (in this lecture) was written with an object-oriented approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the pros of the object-oriented approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects have real-life analogies -- this might help with the code's logic and readability. \n",
    "* Different classes can be designed separately and tested.\n",
    "    * For example, we first designed the <b>Card</b> class and ensured it worked as we expected. Then, we designed the <b>Deck</b>  class, and made sure it worked as expected. Then, we started designing the <b>Player</b>  and so on.\n",
    "* The objects classes that we've designed can be used in other programs\n",
    "    * The <b>Deck</b>  class, for example, might be useful in creating a different card game. We've already implemented a way to shuffle a deck and deal cards from a deck. If another programmer needs to use a deck in a different program, they don't have to worry about all the details of a deck. All they need is information on the methods of the <b>Deck</b>  class (how to call the constructor, how to call the `shuffle()` method, etc).\n",
    "* If we want to add more complexity (a few examples: a <b>Player</b> who is a novice, a <b>Player</b>  who has a specific strategy, a trick Deck), we can create more extensions of the classes that are already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This style of writing programs can be a bit strange at first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking of a program as a series of functions may be more natural. We're used to thinking of functions as something that performs a procedure or performs a calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in OOP, there is a bit more design involved with thinking of what types of objects our program might need, what a class represents, what information it holds, and what procedures (i.e. methods) that object can perform. Then an added layer of complexity  -- thinking of how these objects can interact. As one example, the <b>Player</b> objects can take a <b>Deck</b> object and draw a card from it (see `Player.draw_card()` takes an argument that is a <b>Deck</b> object. The <b>Deck</b>  deals a card (`Deck.deal()` and the Player adds it to `self.hand`.)"
